# Twitter-Bot & Sentiment-Analysis

### Using the Twitter API for minor (hopefully somewhat) useful toy projects

- Cluster-/ hashtag-analysis as described by 
  [EarthLab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-to-apis/twitter-data-in-python/)
  
- Sentiment analysis with text/ regex preprocessing, bag of words etc. 

Should be published (for visibility purposes) after initial jupyter notebooks were removed and the code and repo 
structure is somewhat clean.

### Next steps

- jupyter notebooks will not be functioning (missing data) but probably give some nice code snippets
- additional videos aid explaining stuff from the notebook
- a functioning requirements.txt might be nice, I have to see how this works under Windows
- Stuff like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0wWwglE1Vc) might provide further useful first steps.
